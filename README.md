# Tetris

## Status

The game functions as normal. See [the latest release](https://github.com/tdregmans/Tetris/releases/latest) for the latest version.

## Idea

It is not needed to further elaborate on the idea for this game. This project implements the standard game, known to almost everybody.

## Instructions

The game can be played at [tetris.tdregmans.nl](http://tetris.tdregmans.nl).

The following instructions apply:

- The game starts when the page is loaded.
- The goal is to have as many completed rows. This can be down by moving the block that is coming down.
- The block can be moved to the left by using the '<' key.
- The block can be moved to the right by using the '>' key.
- The block can be rotated clockwise by using the '^' key.
- Once the block can nolonger move, a new block is created.

## File stucture

The game is played in a browser, with `index.html`. The style guide is stored in `css/` and the source code is stored in `js/`.
